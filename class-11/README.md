# Intro to Data Science with Numpy

Python has a vibrant community of Data Science professionals and enthusiasts. The array of tools can be overwhelming, but one thing most of them have in common is the use of Numpy (aka Numeric Python) under the hood.

The tool of choice for most are Jupyter Notebooks.

## Learning Objectives
 - numpy
 - interactive python notebooks
### Students will be able to
 - import and use numpy library
 - use interactive python notebooks

#### Describe and Define

- Different categories under Data Science umbrella
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Differences between Numpy arrays and Python lists

#### Execute

- Jupyter Notebook on development machine
- Display user generated images in Notebook
- Add custom functions to notebook

## Notes
- np.zeros
- np.ones
- np.arange
- np.reshape
- np.getfromtxt
- np.matrix
- np.mean
- np.median
- dataset.shape
- plt.imshow
- mpimg.imread

### Corrections
 - Space Complexity
 - Include both the size of the input AND the size of the auxiliary space used in the execution of the algorithm.
### Terminology
- Lists memory does not need to be together so it's size can be unbounded
- Arrays a contiguous list of memory with a fixed size; Arrays are faster
