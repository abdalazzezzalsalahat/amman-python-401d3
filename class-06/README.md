# Game of Greed 1

Today you'll begin working on a command line version of the dice game `greed` using core Python tools and understanding of the basics of the language. The game is also known as Ten Thousand, Zilch or Foo.

## Learning Objectives
 - Apply logic to solve complex problems
 - Write a command line application
 - Break an application down into modular components and code using OOP
 - Counter library
### Students will be able to
- Plan and prioritize features of application development
- Identify risks in the development lifecycle

#### Describe and Define

- Modularizing components of an application
- Risk Analysis
- Feature prioritization

#### Execute

- Counter module
- Implement game logic
- Create helper classes

### Terms

MVP - Minimum Viable Product
The most basic solution to the user's problem / problem domain.

# TRADE OFF write it myself or find a library - There is no 'correct' answer that applies to all situations
## When to use a lib?
- Complexity
- Algorithm too difficult, When we don't know the algorithm
- Save time
- More optimal solution available in library
- Avoid repeating*
- Known correct implementation; reduce the risk of an incorrect implementation
## When you roll your own?
- Simple algorithm, / easy
- Need to override *
- There is no library for it
- Custom environment
- Custom constraints
