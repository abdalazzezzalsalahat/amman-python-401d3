## Django

- **Why**
  - A **LOT** of websites have been built.
  - In the process certain practices have turned out to be more useful than others.
  - The practices that have shown to be consistently good and significantly better to enough people take on the label "best practices"
  - The term "best practices" is subjective, sometimes a cause for debate, and often used too loosely.
  - But the impulse behind the term is a good thing and can be expressed in other ways...
    - work smart not hard
    - work smarter not harder - this leaves in the idea that you'll still be working hard ;)
    - do more of the good stuff and less of the bad
    - Don't reinvent the wheel

- **What**
  - Sometimes you'll get enough people agreeing on the best ways to combine those practices and a "framework" emerges.
  - One of the most popular, and long lasting, frameworks around is [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
    - Check out the first qoute you see "Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code."
    - Highlight the page title "The Web Framework for Perfectionists with Deadlines"
    - Head down to the **Meet Django** section and tease out the common themes like rapid, fast, clean and pragmatic.
- **How**
  - Django is quite mature and is very clear on what it wants to do.
  - Django is an "opinionated" framework
    - Django makes many of the upfront choices about starting a project
    - Though there is flexibility to make changes as needed
