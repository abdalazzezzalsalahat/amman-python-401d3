##Ô∏è Django REST Framework & Docker

The combination of Django and Django REST Framework is a powerful and fast way to develop APIs.

Docker is great way to guard against the dreaded `but it works on my machine!` developer curse.

Today we'll work on converting a Django app into a proper API then wrap it up in a Docker container.


#### Describe and Define

- Serializers as an API's view of the data
- What problems Docker solves
- How Docker can coordinate multiple services
- Difference between a Docker Image and a Container

#### Execute

- Expose API and allow users to interact with it
- Reach into a Docker container and modify it
- Share files between host OS and container
