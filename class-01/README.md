It's extremely critical that you're set up and ready to go on day 1, and if not you need to **notify your instructor** as soon as possible regarding any of the pre-work that you were unable to complete.

Terms

Terminal -  In Client Server Architecture we had slow computers called terminals or dumb terminals that provided a keyboard (standard input) and a screen (standard out) for communicating the users commands to the server which did the actual work.
We use the term terminal to refer to a GUI program that runs a command line shell.

Interpreter - Program that executes a programming language without requiring the source code to be compiled.
ex.
